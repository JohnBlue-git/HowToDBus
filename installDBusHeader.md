## alternative

you can manually download and install D-Bus from source if the package is not available via your package manager. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

Downloading and Installing D-Bus from Source
wget https://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.12.20.tar.gz
Replace 1.12.20 with the latest version available.

Extract the Tarball:
tar -xzf dbus-1.12.20.tar.gz
cd dbus-1.12.20

Install Build Dependencies: Before building, make sure you have the necessary tools and libraries:
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libtool
You might also need other dependencies like libglib2.0-dev.

Configure the Build:
./configure

Compile the Source:
make

Install the Library:
sudo make install
